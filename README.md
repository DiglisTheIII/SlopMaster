Open source so go ahead and put it in whatever discord if you want to host it yourself and/or modify it.

USE [JDA 5.0.0](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA)
 
Create a Token.java file that has a static final TOKEN variable and call it in jda#createDefault in Main.java.


Also, Be sure to delete the member folder. I will put it in gitignore next update.
